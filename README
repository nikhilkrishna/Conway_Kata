This is a coding excercise undertaken by Ashik Salahudeen, Santosh Raju and Nikhil Krishna. 
The nominal objective is to create a program that runs Conways Game of Life simulation.
However the real goal is to practise pair programming, TDD and brush up on Vim, etc.
In short if you are looking for a working program here, you might be disappointed :-)
